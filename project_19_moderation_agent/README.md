---

## Project Description

This project demonstrates how to implement a content moderation agent that filters user input. The agent uses a function to check for banned words. If the input is inappropriate, the agent will respond with a warning; otherwise, it will proceed with the request. This is a basic example of how to build safety features into your agents.

## Usage Instructions

1.  **Install the necessary libraries:**

    ```bash
    pip install google-adk==0.1.0
    ```

2.  **Run the script:**

    ```bash
    python project_19_moderation_agent.py
    ```

3.  **Interact with the agent:**

    Try sending both appropriate and inappropriate messages to the agent. For example:

    *   `Hello, how are you?`
    *   `This is an example of a bad word.`

4.  **Expected Output:**

    The agent will either respond normally or with a moderation warning, depending on the input.
