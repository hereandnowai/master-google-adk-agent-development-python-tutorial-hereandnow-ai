# Project 17: Data Visualization Agent

*designed with passion for innovation*

## Project Description

This project demonstrates how to create an agent that generates data visualizations. The agent will use a Python plotting library (matplotlib) to create a plot of a mathematical function and save it as an image file. This is a powerful example of how to give your agent the ability to generate rich, non-textual content.

## Usage Instructions

1.  **Install the necessary libraries:**

    ```bash
    pip install google-adk==0.1.0 matplotlib
    ```

2.  **Run the script:**

    ```bash
    python project_17_plot_agent.py
    ```

3.  **Interact with the agent:**

    When prompted, ask the agent to plot a function, for example:

    ```
    Plot x^2 from -10 to 10
    ```

4.  **Expected Output:**

    The agent will generate a plot and save it as `plot.png` in the current directory. It will then return a message confirming that the plot has been created.
