# Project 26: Multi-Agent Collaboration

**HERE AND NOW AI**

*designed with passion for innovation*

---

## Project Description

This project demonstrates how to implement Agent-to-Agent (A2A) communication. Two expert agents will exchange messages to solve a problem collaboratively. For example, one agent might provide data, and the other might analyze it. This is an advanced example of how to build complex systems where agents can work together.

## Usage Instructions

1.  **Install the necessary libraries:**

    ```bash
    pip install google-adk==0.1.0
    ```

2.  **Run the script:**

    ```bash
    python project_26_a2a_collaboration.py
    ```

3.  **Interact with the agent:**

    When prompted, enter a problem that requires collaboration between the two agents, for example:

    ```
    Analyze the following data: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    ```

4.  **Expected Output:**

    The agents will work together to solve the problem and provide a result.
