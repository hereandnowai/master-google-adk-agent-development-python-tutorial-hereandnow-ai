**HERE AND NOW AI**

*designed with passion for innovation*

---

## Project Description

This project demonstrates how to use the ADK's built-in GitHub toolset to create an agent that can interact with GitHub. The agent will be able to fetch open issues from a given repository. This is a powerful example of how to connect your agent to external services and automate development workflows.

## Usage Instructions

1.  **Install the necessary libraries:**

    ```bash
    pip install google-adk==0.1.0 PyGithub
    ```

2.  **Set up GitHub authentication:**

    You will need a GitHub personal access token. You can create one [here](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token).

3.  **Set the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable:**

    ```bash
    export GITHUB_TOKEN="your_personal_access_token"
    ```

4.  **Run the script:**

    ```bash
    python project_15_github_issues.py
    ```

5.  **Interact with the agent:**

    When prompted, ask the agent to list the open issues in a repository, for example:

    ```
    List open issues in the repository "google/generative-ai-python"
    ```
