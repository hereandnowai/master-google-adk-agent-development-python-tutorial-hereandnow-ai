# Project 25: Autonomous Research Agent

**HERE AND NOW AI**

*designed with passion for innovation*

---

## Project Description

This project demonstrates how to build an autonomous research agent. The agent will take a research query, plan a sequence of actions (e.g., search, browse, summarize), and then execute those actions to compile a report. This is an advanced example of how to build an agent that can perform complex tasks with a high degree of autonomy.

## Usage Instructions

1.  **Install the necessary libraries:**

    ```bash
    pip install google-adk==0.1.0
    ```

2.  **Run the script:**

    ```bash
    python project_25_research_agent.py
    ```

3.  **Interact with the agent:**

    When prompted, enter a research query, for example:

    ```
    Research the latest advancements in quantum computing.
    ```

4.  **Expected Output:**

    The agent will provide a research report on the topic, including a summary and a list of sources.
