*designed with passion for innovation*

---

## Project Description

This project simulates a voice assistant that handles streaming audio. It uses ADK's streaming features to process a continuous stream of user messages (simulating transcribed audio). The agent can schedule actions based on speech commands, demonstrating how to build real-time, interactive agents.

## Usage Instructions

1.  **Install the necessary libraries:**

    ```bash
    pip install google-adk==0.1.0
    ```

2.  **Run the script:**

    ```bash
    python project_23_audio_chatbot.py
    ```

3.  **Interact with the agent:**

    The script will simulate a stream of audio by processing your text input in real-time. You can type commands and the agent will respond as if it were a voice assistant.
