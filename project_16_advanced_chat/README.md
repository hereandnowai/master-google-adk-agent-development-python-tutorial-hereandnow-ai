**HERE AND NOW AI**

*designed with passion for innovation*

---

## Project Description

This project demonstrates how to enhance a chatbot with logging and more persistent memory. It uses ADK's callback system to trace the agent's execution, which is useful for debugging and monitoring. It also shows how to use a more persistent form of memory to maintain conversation history across sessions.

## Usage Instructions

1.  **Install the necessary libraries:**

    ```bash
    pip install google-adk==0.1.0
    ```

2.  **Run the script:**

    ```bash
    python project_16_advanced_chat.py
    ```

3.  **Interact with the agent:**

    Have a conversation with the agent. The agent's actions will be logged to the console, and the conversation history will be saved to a file.
