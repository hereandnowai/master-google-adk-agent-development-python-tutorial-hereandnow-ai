*designed with passion for innovation*

## Project Description

This project introduces the concept of a multi-agent system where a "master" agent delegates tasks to specialized "sub-agents". In this example, the master agent will take a request to "plan a weekend" and break it down into two sub-tasks: finding activities and finding restaurants. The results from the sub-agents are then combined.

## Usage Instructions

1.  **Install the necessary libraries:**

    ```bash
    pip install google-adk==0.1.0
    ```

2.  **Run the script:**

    ```bash
    python project_10_multi_agent.py
    ```

3.  **Interact with the agent:**

    When prompted, ask the agent to plan a weekend in a city, for example:

    ```
    Plan a weekend in Paris
    ```

4.  **Expected Output:**

    The agent will provide a plan with suggestions for both activities and restaurants.
