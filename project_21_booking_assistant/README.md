# Project 21: Enterprise Booking Assistant

**HERE AND NOW AI**

*designed with passion for innovation*

---

## Project Description

This project demonstrates a complex multi-agent system for booking travel. A coordinator agent manages flight, hotel, and car rental sub-agents. It merges the plans from the sub-agents, uses parallel workflows to gather information, and handles errors gracefully. This is an example of how to build a sophisticated, enterprise-level agent.

## Usage Instructions

1.  **Install the necessary libraries:**

    ```bash
    pip install google-adk==0.1.0
    ```

2.  **Run the script:**

    ```bash
    python project_21_booking_assistant.py
    ```

3.  **Interact with the agent:**

    When prompted, ask the agent to book a trip, for example:

    ```
    Book a trip to San Francisco from September 1st to September 5th, including a flight, hotel, and car rental.
    ```

4.  **Expected Output:**

    The agent will provide a complete travel itinerary with details for the flight, hotel, and car rental.
