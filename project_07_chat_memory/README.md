*designed with passion for innovation*

---

## Project Description

This project demonstrates how to build a chat agent that can remember previous parts of the conversation. The agent uses ADK's session management to maintain context. This allows the agent to have more natural and context-aware conversations.

## Usage Instructions

1.  **Install the necessary libraries:**

    ```bash
    pip install google-adk==0.1.0
    ```

2.  **Run the script:**

    ```bash
    python project_07_chat_memory.py
    ```

3.  **Interact with the agent:**

    Have a conversation with the agent. It should remember what you said previously. For example:

    ```
    You: My name is John.
    Agent: Nice to meet you, John! What can I help you with today?
    You: What is my name?
    Agent: Your name is John.
    ```
