# Project 9: Multi-Tool Assistant

**HERE AND NOW AI**

*designed with passion for innovation*

---

## Project Description

This project demonstrates how to build an agent that can use multiple tools. The agent will have access to both the built-in Google Search tool and a custom math tool. This allows the agent to handle a wider range of tasks, from answering general knowledge questions to performing calculations.

## Usage Instructions

1.  **Install the necessary libraries:**

    ```bash
    pip install google-adk==0.1.0
    ```

2.  **Run the script:**

    ```bash
    python project_09_multi_tool.py
    ```

3.  **Interact with the agent:**

    You can ask the agent questions that require either search or calculation. For example:

    *   `What is the tallest building in the world?`
    *   `calc 12 + 34 * 5`
