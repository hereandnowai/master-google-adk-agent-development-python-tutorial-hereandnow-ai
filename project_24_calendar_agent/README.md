## Project Description

This project demonstrates how to build a meeting scheduling assistant that can integrate with an external API like Google Calendar. The agent will be able to handle scheduling conflicts, ask for alternative times, and use loops to manage the conversation. This is an advanced example of how to build a practical, interactive agent.

## Usage Instructions

1.  **Install the necessary libraries:**

    ```bash
    pip install google-adk==0.1.0
    ```

2.  **Run the script:**

    ```bash
    python project_24_calendar_agent.py
    ```

3.  **Interact with the agent:**

    When prompted, ask the agent to schedule a meeting, for example:

    ```
    Schedule a meeting with John Doe for tomorrow at 2pm to discuss the project.
    ```

4.  **Expected Output:**

    The agent will guide you through the process of scheduling the meeting, handling any conflicts that may arise.
