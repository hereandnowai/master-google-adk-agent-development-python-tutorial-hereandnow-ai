## Project Description

This project demonstrates how to create a multi-step task planning agent. The agent will take a high-level goal, like "Plan a birthday party," and break it down into a series of smaller, actionable steps. This is a more advanced example of a workflow agent that can be used for project planning.

## Usage Instructions

1.  **Install the necessary libraries:**

    ```bash
    pip install google-adk==0.1.0
    ```

2.  **Run the script:**

    ```bash
    python project_11_task_planner.py
    ```

3.  **Interact with the agent:**

    When prompted, enter a goal that you want to plan, for example:

    ```
    Plan a birthday party
    ```

4.  **Expected Output:**

    The agent will output a to-do list with the steps required to achieve the goal.
