**HERE AND NOW AI**

*designed with passion for innovation*

---

## Project Description

This project demonstrates how to deploy multiple agents in parallel for load balancing. It simulates a scenario where multiple instances of an agent handle different tasks, showing how to scale `Runner` processes. This is a conceptual example of how to build a scalable agent network using a technology like Kubernetes.

## Usage Instructions

1.  **Install the necessary libraries:**

    ```bash
    pip install google-adk==0.1.0
    ```

2.  **Run the script:**

    ```bash
    python project_28_scalable_network.py
    ```

3.  **Expected Output:**

    The script will simulate running multiple agent instances in parallel and print the output from each instance.
