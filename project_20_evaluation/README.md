## Project Description

This project demonstrates how to create a pipeline to automatically test an agent's accuracy. It uses ADK's built-in evaluation tools to run an agent against a set of input/output pairs and measure its performance. This is a crucial step in building reliable and high-quality agents.

## Usage Instructions

1.  **Install the necessary libraries:**

    ```bash
    pip install google-adk==0.1.0
    ```

2.  **Run the script:**

    ```bash
    python project_20_evaluation.py
    ```

3.  **Expected Output:**

    The script will run the evaluation and print a report with the agent's accuracy and any failures.
