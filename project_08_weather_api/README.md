# Project 8: Weather API Agent

**HERE AND NOW AI**

*designed with passion for innovation*

---

## Project Description

This project shows how to create an agent that can call an external API. The agent will use a function tool to fetch weather data from a weather API service (e.g., OpenWeatherMap). This is a practical example of how to connect your agent to real-world data sources.

## Usage Instructions

1.  **Install the necessary libraries:**

    ```bash
    pip install google-adk==0.1.0 requests
    ```

2.  **Get an API Key:**

    Sign up for a free API key from a weather service like [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api).

3.  **Set up your API key:**

    Replace `"YOUR_API_KEY"` in the Python script with your actual API key.

4.  **Run the script:**

    ```bash
    python project_08_weather_api.py
    ```

5.  **Interact with the agent:**

    Ask for the weather in a specific city, for example:

    ```
    What is the weather in New York?
    ```
