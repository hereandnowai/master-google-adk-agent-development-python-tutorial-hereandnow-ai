## Welcome to the Future of Agent Development!

This repository hosts a meticulously crafted tutorial series designed to guide you through the exciting world of Google's Agent Development Kit (ADK). Whether you're a beginner taking your first steps into AI agents or an experienced developer looking to master advanced ADK features, this collection of 30 distinct projects offers a progressive learning path.

## What is Google ADK?

Google's Agent Development Kit (ADK) is a powerful framework that simplifies the creation, deployment, and management of intelligent agents. It provides a robust set of tools and abstractions that enable developers to:

*   **Build Intelligent Agents:** Design agents capable of understanding natural language, making decisions, and performing actions.
*   **Integrate with External Services:** Seamlessly connect agents to various APIs, databases, and web services.
*   **Orchestrate Complex Workflows:** Create sophisticated multi-step processes using sequential, parallel, and loop-based agent workflows.
*   **Leverage Advanced AI Capabilities:** Incorporate features like memory, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and multi-agent collaboration.
*   **Ensure Robustness:** Implement comprehensive error handling and utilize callbacks for monitoring and debugging.

With ADK, you can transform complex AI concepts into practical, deployable solutions, from simple chatbots to autonomous research assistants and enterprise-grade booking systems.

## About This Tutorial Series

This series comprises 30 hands-on projects, each designed to introduce and solidify your understanding of key ADK concepts. The projects are structured with increasing complexity, ensuring a smooth learning curve:

*   **Beginner Projects (1-10):** Focus on core ADK components, including basic agent setup, custom function tools, built-in search, sequential and parallel workflows, loop agents, and chat memory.
*   **Intermediate Projects (11-20):** Dive into more advanced integrations and functionalities, such as task planning, travel itinerary generation, LangChain tool integration (Wikipedia, StackExchange), GitHub interaction, advanced memory with callbacks, data visualization, and agent deployment examples.
*   **Advanced Projects (21-30):** Explore sophisticated multi-agent systems, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), real-time interaction simulation, external API integrations (e.g., Google Calendar simulation), autonomous research, multi-agent collaboration, code review automation, scalable agent networks, and performance tuning.

Each project includes a dedicated folder containing:

*   `project_XX_name.py`: The Python script demonstrating the ADK features.
*   `README.md`: A detailed explanation of the project, its goals, and step-by-step usage instructions.

## Getting Started

To begin your journey with Google ADK, follow these simple steps:

1.  **Clone this repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/hereandnowai/master-google-adk-agent-development-python-tutorial-hereandnow-ai.git
    cd master-google-adk-agent-development-python-tutorial-hereandnow-ai
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies:**

    A common `requirements.txt` file is provided in the root directory, listing all necessary Python packages for the entire series. It is recommended to use a virtual environment.

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Explore Projects:**

    Navigate into any project folder (e.g., `project_01_hello_agent`) and follow the instructions in its `README.md` to run the specific example.

    ```bash
    cd project_01_hello_agent
    python project_01_hello_agent.py
    ```
