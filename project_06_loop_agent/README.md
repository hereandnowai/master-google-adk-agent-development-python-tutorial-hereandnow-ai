## Project Description

This project demonstrates the use of a `Loop` agent in ADK. The `Loop` agent will repeatedly execute a task until a specific condition is met. In this example, the agent will keep asking math questions until the user types "exit". This is useful for creating interactive and conversational agents.

## Usage Instructions

1.  **Install the necessary libraries:**

    ```bash
    pip install google-adk==0.1.0
    ```

2.  **Run the script:**

    ```bash
    python project_06_loop_agent.py
    ```

3.  **Interact with the agent:**

    The agent will ask you a math question. You can answer it, and it will continue to ask questions until you type "exit".

4.  **Expected Output:**

    The agent will engage in a continuous conversation, asking math questions and evaluating your answers.
