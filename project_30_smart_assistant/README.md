**HERE AND NOW AI**

*designed with passion for innovation*

---

## Project Description

This capstone project brings together many of the concepts covered in the previous projects to create a smart assistant. The assistant will have memory, be able to use tools (RAG for document retrieval and APIs for scheduling), and be deployed as a service. This is a comprehensive example of how to build a sophisticated and practical ADK application.

## Usage Instructions

1.  **Install the necessary libraries:**

    ```bash
    pip install google-adk==0.1.0 faiss-cpu requests
    ```

2.  **Create a `documents` directory:**

    Create a directory named `documents` and place some text files in it (e.g., travel guides).

3.  **Run the script:**

    ```bash
    python project_30_smart_assistant.py
    ```

4.  **Interact with the agent:**

    You can ask the agent to perform a variety of tasks, such as answering questions about your documents, scheduling meetings, or having a conversation.
