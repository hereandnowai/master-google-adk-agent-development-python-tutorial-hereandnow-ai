# Project 5: Parallel Agents Example

**HERE AND NOW AI**

*designed with passion for innovation*

---

## Project Description

This project demonstrates how to run multiple agents in parallel. The main agent will have two sub-agents: one to fetch the weather and another to get the latest news. Both sub-agents will run concurrently, and their results will be combined. This is useful for tasks that can be performed independently and simultaneously.

## Usage Instructions

1.  **Install the necessary libraries:**

    ```bash
    pip install google-adk==0.1.0
    ```

2.  **Run the script:**

    ```bash
    python project_05_parallel_agent.py
    ```

3.  **Interact with the agent:**

    When prompted, enter a city for the weather and a topic for the news, for example:

    ```
    Weather in London and news about technology
    ```

4.  **Expected Output:**

    The agent will provide both the weather and news information.
