## Project Description

This project demonstrates how to use LangChain's StackExchange API tool to create a Q&A bot for programming questions. The agent will be able to search StackOverflow for answers to your coding problems. This is another example of how to extend ADK with the rich toolset of LangChain.

## Usage Instructions

1.  **Install the necessary libraries:**

    ```bash
    pip install google-adk==0.1.0 langchain stackapi
    ```

2.  **Run the script:**

    ```bash
    python project_14_stackoverflow_bot.py
    ```

3.  **Interact with the agent:**

    When prompted, ask a programming question, for example:

    ```
    How to sort a dictionary by value in Python?
    ```

4.  **Expected Output:**

    The agent will search StackOverflow and provide a relevant answer to your question.
