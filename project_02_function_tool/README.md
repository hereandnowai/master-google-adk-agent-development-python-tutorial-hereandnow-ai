## Project Description

This project demonstrates how to create a custom tool for an ADK agent. The agent will use a Python function to perform unit conversions (e.g., kilometers to miles). This example illustrates how to extend an agent's capabilities with your own logic.

## Usage Instructions

1.  **Install the necessary libraries:**

    ```bash
    pip install google-adk==0.1.0
    ```

2.  **Run the script:**

    ```bash
    python project_02_function_tool.py
    ```

3.  **Interact with the agent:**

    When prompted, enter a conversion query, for example:

    ```
    convert 10 km to miles
    ```

4.  **Expected Output:**

    The agent will use the custom tool to calculate the conversion and print the result:

    ```
    10 kilometers is equal to 6.2137 miles.
    ```
