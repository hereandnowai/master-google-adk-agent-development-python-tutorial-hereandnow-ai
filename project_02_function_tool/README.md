## Project Description

This project demonstrates how to create a custom tool for an ADK agent. The agent will use a Python function to perform unit conversions (e.g., kilometers to miles). This example illustrates how to extend an agent's capabilities with your own logic.

## Usage Instructions

1.  **Install the necessary libraries:**

    ```bash
    pip install google-adk==0.1.0
    ```

2.  **Run the script:**

    # 1. Go to your projects directory
    cd ~/Documents/Projects

    # 2. Create the project
    adk create app MyChatAgent

    # (The ADK might ask you some questions here, like the agent type)

    # 3. Go into the project directory
    cd MyChatAgent

    # 5. Run the agent
    adk run app

3.  **Interact with the agent:**

    When prompted, enter a conversion query, for example:

    ```
    convert 10 km to miles
    ```

4.  **Expected Output:**

    The agent will use the custom tool to calculate the conversion and print the result:

    ```
    10 kilometers is equal to 6.2137 miles.
    ```
