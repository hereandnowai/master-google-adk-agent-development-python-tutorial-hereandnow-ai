## Project Description

This project introduces the concept of a sequential workflow in ADK. A sequential workflow executes a series of tasks in a specific order. In this example, the agent will first search for a topic and then summarize the search results. This is a basic form of a research agent.

## Usage Instructions

1.  **Install the necessary libraries:**

    ```bash
    pip install google-adk==0.1.0
    ```

2.  **Run the script:**

    ```bash
    python project_04_sequential_agent.py
    ```

3.  **Interact with the agent:**

    When prompted, enter a topic to research, for example:

    ```
    The history of artificial intelligence
    ```

4.  **Expected Output:**

    The agent will first perform a search and then provide a summary of the findings.
