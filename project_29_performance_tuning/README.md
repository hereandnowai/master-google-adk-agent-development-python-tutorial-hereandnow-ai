## Project Description

This project demonstrates how to profile and optimize an ADK agent's performance. It uses timing callbacks to track how long an agent takes per step and then shows how to optimize it by adjusting concurrency or model parameters. This is an important step in building efficient and responsive agents.

## Usage Instructions

1.  **Install the necessary libraries:**

    ```bash
    pip install google-adk==0.1.0
    ```

2.  **Run the script:**

    ```bash
    python project_29_performance_tuning.py
    ```

3.  **Expected Output:**

    The script will print the time it takes for the agent to complete each step, allowing you to identify and optimize performance bottlenecks.
