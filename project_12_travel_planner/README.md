**HERE AND NOW AI**

*designed with passion for innovation*

---

## Project Description

This project demonstrates how to build an agent that can propose a travel itinerary. Given a destination and dates, the agent will search for flights and hotels (using dummy data for this example) and create a plan. This project showcases how to use multiple agents in parallel to gather information and then combine it into a structured output.

## Usage Instructions

1.  **Install the necessary libraries:**

    ```bash
    pip install google-adk==0.1.0
    ```

2.  **Run the script:**

    ```bash
    python project_12_travel_planner.py
    ```

3.  **Interact with the agent:**

    When prompted, enter your travel details, for example:

    ```
    I want to travel to Tokyo from August 1st to August 7th
    ```

4.  **Expected Output:**

    The agent will provide a travel itinerary with flight and hotel suggestions.
