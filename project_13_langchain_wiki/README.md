## Project Description

This project demonstrates how to integrate LangChain tools with the Google ADK. Specifically, it uses LangChain's Wikipedia lookup tool to create a bot that can answer factual questions by searching Wikipedia. This shows how to leverage the vast ecosystem of LangChain tools within your ADK agents.

## Usage Instructions

1.  **Install the necessary libraries:**

    ```bash
    pip install google-adk==0.1.0 langchain wikipedia
    ```

2.  **Run the script:**

    ```bash
    python project_13_langchain_wiki.py
    ```

3.  **Interact with the agent:**

    When prompted, ask a question that can be answered by Wikipedia, for example:

    ```
    Who was the first person to walk on the moon?
    ```

4.  **Expected Output:**

    The agent will use the Wikipedia tool to find the answer and present it to you.
